# ffmpeg-commands

A Kotlin tool that generates ffmpeg conversion commands for video files. The tool analyzes input files and creates
optimized transcoding commands with automatic language handling for audio and subtitles.

## Usage

To use this tool, you need to have Java installed on your system. Run the tool using:

```bash
java -jar ffmpeg-commands.jar filename.mkv [options]
```

### Available Parameters

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alias`                         | Set custom alias for ffmpeg command                                                       |
| `additionalLanguages`           | Comma-separated list of additional languages to include (default: deu, ger, eng)          |
| `docker`                        | Create command to directly run in docker mode                                             |
| `unstarted`                     | When used with `-docker`, creates a container but does not start it (requires `-docker`)  |
| `dropSubtitles`                 | Drop all subtitles from output                                                            |
| `ignoreMissingSubtitleLanguage` | Ignore streams with missing subtitle language                                             |
| `fixClusterTimestampWarning`    | Add `-max_interleave_delta 0` to prevent ffmpeg from creating new clusters when timestamps are slightly out of order, which can cause playback issues on some devices |
| `setAudioLanguages`             | Comma-separated list of languages to assign to audio streams without language information |

## Behavior

- When no parameters are given, only German and English streams are considered for audio tracks.
- Audio streams are always ordered: German, English, then all additional languages.
- When no AC3 stream is present, the tool adds an AC3 transcoded stream as the last audio track. This is necessary
  because some devices (like LG TVs) do not support DTS playback.

## Building

To build this project from source, you'll need Gradle installed. Clone the repository and run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will create a jar file in the `build/libs` directory.

## Running

After building, you can run the tool with:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/ffmpeg-commands-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar inputfile.mkv [options]
```

Or if you're using Docker mode:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/ffmpeg-commands-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar inputfile.mkv -docker
```
